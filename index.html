<h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">was established in 1978</h5>


<p class="text-muted">The church and the community as a unit, used to be a source of values, of commitment, of stability and strength for children. Each of these institutions plays an important role in education and upbringing. Teachers might be used to help develop relevant job skills and supply basic literacy for those needing it, if funds and talent are available. Religion is separated from school system because it represents a strong ideology held by one group of people (Viteritti, 2007). When a single religious tradition like Christianity is numerically dominant, support for a public religion can quite easily yield preferential treatment for the majority religion. A single religious tradition can so dominate as to threaten the dissenting beliefs of other religions and of the nonreligious.</p>
